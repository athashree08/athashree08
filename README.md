Data Science BTech Student | Code meets Creativity | Building My Own Story (with Tech)

ðŸŒ¸ I love mixing tech with personality - whether itâ€™s AI, UI, or turning chaos into cute code.  
From pastel CSS to powerful Python, I explore tools that spark both logic and joy.

### ðŸŒ± Currently Growing In:
- Full-stack development (Web dev , DSA, Python)
- Django Framework
- AI and Machine Learning (the fun, responsible kind)
- UI/UX that feels like a warm hug

â˜• Catch me dreaming in variables, designing with vibes, and debugging like a detective.

ðŸŽ¯ Always curious, always caffeinated, always creating.
### Forever in my *Dev Era*.
